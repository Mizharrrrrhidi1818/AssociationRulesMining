# Association Rules

Select any transactional dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets or https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php. 

Conduct an association rule analysis, including:

generating frequent item sets and association rules for three different pairs of support and confidence thresholds,
comparing the impact of changing the thresholds on the number and quality of rules,
identifying the most interesting rules and their potential significance in the context of the data.

Prepare a report on your work (a Python script with comments, a recorded video, or a PDF report) that includes a description of the selected set, the methodology used, the analysis results, and conclusions.

Submit your completed assignment for grading.
